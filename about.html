  Poverty is not being without money but being without hope.Poverty diminishes confidence .If someone offers us a grain store ,
  even if we really need plough,we take what is offered to us.

  Mother Teresa was an Albanian-Indian Roman Catholic nun and missionary. She founded the Order of the Missionaries of Charity,
   a Roman Catholic congregation of women dedicated to helping the poor. Many consider her to be one of the 20th Century's greatest humanitarians. She was canonized as Saint
    Teresa of Calcutta in 2016.
With her poverty quote, Mother Theresa provides some insight into what poverty can be. Since poverty arises from deprivation, society can deprive people of love and care. Mother Theresa submits that it is the greatest form of poverty,
 and we cannot but agree with her because every human wants to love and care for others. It's the reason most of us are still living.
